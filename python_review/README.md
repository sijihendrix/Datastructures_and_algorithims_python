### Exercise 1: In the following exercise you will finish writing smallest_positive which is a function that finds the smallest positive number in a list.

### Exercise 2: Now let's assume you are planning on taking some additional courses at your local educational institution, and you have acquired some data about the available courses and when they will be offered. In the following exercise, you will write control structures to process the data and return the semesters when a given course is offered.

You will need to complete the function when_offered(courses, course). This function accepts a "courses" data structure and a "course" string. The function should return a list of strings representing the semesters when the input course is offered. See the two test cases below for examples of correct results.

Since the when_offered function accepts a dictionary data structure, you will find the construct useful, as this loops through the key values in a dictionary.

```python
 for <key> in <dictionary>:
    <block>
```
